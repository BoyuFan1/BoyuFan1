My focus is on enhancing students' comprehension and application of fundamental mathematical concepts, particularly in Linear Algebra and Concepts of Statistics. I work with students both in one-on-one settings and in group sessions. More information can be found at the [student learning center website](https://slc.berkeley.edu/home).
