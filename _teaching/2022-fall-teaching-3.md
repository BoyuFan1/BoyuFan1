This course focused on expanding the computational concepts and techniques of abstraction introduced in Foundations of Data Science (C8), emphasizing the understanding of structures underpinning programs, algorithms, and languages used in data science and other areas. My responsibility was to provide focused academic support, guiding students through complex programming concepts and facilitating their mastery of the course material, which included functional, object-oriented, and declarative programming.
