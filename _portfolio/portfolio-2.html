title: "Build Your Own World"
excerpt: "It's a game engine that crafts a navigable 2D tile-based world. The novelty lies in its use of pseudo-random seeds, ensuring each generated world is unique and tractable. <br/><img src='/BoyuFan1/images/BYOW500x300.png'>"

- World Generation: Uses a pseudo-random seed to create varied and unique 2D tile-based worlds.
- Dynamic Environment: The world includes randomly generated elements like flowers, grass, and water, creating a visually diverse setting.
- Avatar and Line of Sight: The player controls an avatar. By pressing 'v', the game toggles a feature called sightEnabled, which limits visibility to tiles within the avatar's line of sight. This feature can be switched on and off to alter gameplay.
- Game Objective: The player's goal is to locate all flowers while the sightEnabled feature is active, adding a layer of challenge and exploration.
- Technical Specifications: The engine, built in Java, features robust methods for world creation, including room generation, hallway construction, and avatar movement. It also includes methods for saving and loading game states.

The game encourages exploration and strategy, as players must navigate through the dynamically generated world to achieve their objectives under varying visibility conditions. This engine represents a blend of procedural generation techniques and interactive gameplay elements.
