title: "Build Your Own World"
excerpt: "It's a game engine that crafts a navigable 2D tile-based world. The novelty lies in its use of pseudo-random seeds, ensuring each generated world is unique and tractable. <br/><img src='/BoyuFan1/images/BYOW500x300.png'>"

<p><strong>World Generation:</strong> Uses a pseudo-random seed to create varied and unique 2D tile-based worlds.</p>
<p><strong>Dynamic Environment:</strong> The world includes randomly generated elements like flowers, grass, and water, creating a visually diverse setting.</p>
<p><strong>Avatar and Line of Sight:</strong> The player controls an avatar. By pressing 'v', the game toggles a feature called <em>sightEnabled</em>, which limits visibility to tiles within the avatar's line of sight. This feature can be switched on and off to alter gameplay.</p>
<p><strong>Game Objective:</strong> The player's goal is to locate all flowers while the <em>sightEnabled</em> feature is active, adding a layer of challenge and exploration.</p>
<p><strong>Technical Specifications:</strong> The engine, built in Java, features robust methods for world creation, including room generation, hallway construction, and avatar movement. It also includes methods for saving and loading game states.</p>

<p>The game encourages exploration and strategy, as players must navigate through the dynamically generated world to achieve their objectives under varying visibility conditions. This engine represents a blend of procedural generation techniques and interactive gameplay elements.</p>
