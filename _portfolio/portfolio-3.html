<p><strong>Solver GPT - AI Chatbox Application:</strong> The application segments the uploaded text into chunks, converting them into embeddings using OpenAI or HuggingFace Embeddings. This facilitates efficient similarity searches in a FAISS vector store. The highlight is the ConversationalRetrievalChain, which integrates a pre-trained ChatOpenAI model with the vector store. This offers users relevant responses from the PDF content based on their queries.</p>
