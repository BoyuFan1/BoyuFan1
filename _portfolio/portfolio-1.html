title: "Lion Light"
excerpt: "During my high school years, I was inspired by a TED talk by Richard Turere to design a cost-effective and technically improved version of the \"lion light,\" a device that uses blinking lights to scare lions away from livestock, and partnered with the NGO China House for its distribution. <br/><img src='/BoyuFan1/images/lion1.jpg'>"

        <p>My adventure began after being inspired by a TED talk by Richard Turere, a Maasai boy who created a "lion light" to protect livestock from predators. Upon arriving in Kenya, I was confronted with the realities of human-wildlife conflict, witnessing firsthand the challenges faced by communities living alongside wildlife. I learned about various mitigation methods, including traditional fencing, innovative Beehive Fences, and pepper fences, but found a particular interest in the concept of lion lights.</p>

        <p>During my time in Kenya, I met with pioneers like David Mascall and Michael Mbithi, who had developed their own versions of lion lights. While these inventions were effective, I observed that they were still prohibitively expensive and faced technical issues. Motivated to make a difference, I embarked on a project to create a more affordable and reliable lion light. My design focused on maintaining the essential deterrent function while incorporating cost-effective and durable materials. I experimented with an infrasonic emitter and a brighter LED light, powered by Ni-Cd batteries for enhanced longevity.</p>
