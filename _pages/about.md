Greetings üåç!

I'm Boyu Fan, a senior at UC Berkeley, where I'm double majoring in Economics and Data Science with a minor in Statistics. My academic journey is marked by a deep engagement in Machine Learning research and the experiments of uncertainty quantification for perturbation intervals.

When I'm not diving into data, you can find me playing tennis, trying out new recipes, or playing pieces by Vivaldi and Schubert. I love exploring new ideas and embrace the possibilities that come with innovation and curiosity.

## üîç Research Interest
My research interests lie at the intersection of advanced computational methodologies and data-driven analysis, particularly focusing on the application of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Conditional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) within the TensorFlow framework. My work primarily revolves around time series data analysis in the context of network performance optimization. I am deeply engaged in developing novel predictive tools and methodologies, utilizing Tstat log data to enhance network efficiency and reliability.

## üå± Conservationist 
In the heart of Kenya, I found my calling as a conservationist with the Lion Light project, a initiative blending technology and environmental stewardship.

As the Chief Advocate, I've been instrumental in installing innovative lion lights, which uses blinking light patterns to ward off lions from the villager‚Äôs livestock. My role extends beyond just installation; it involves research, community engagement, and raising awareness. By raising $7000, we've expanded the project, installing 800 additional lights and earning heartfelt thanks from the local Kenyan community.

## üìä Work Experience

### Deloitte | Risk Advisory Modeling Intern (May - August 2023)

In my role at Deloitte, I focused on enhancing sovereign risk models by performing rigorous data cleaning and feature extraction on datasets from the World Bank and IMF. I employed advanced feature engineering techniques like K-means and agglomerative clustering, along with univariate analysis using tools such as Somer's D, ROC, and information value. My work culminated in the construction of a sovereign risk classification model using logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, significantly improving the model's accuracy from 40% to 78% and streamlining data processing with proficient use of SQL.

### Apple | Data Analysis Engineering Intern (July - August 2022)

At Apple, I collaborated with the Global Channel sales team to develop and execute effective business and sales strategies. My key contributions included orchestrating the design and implementation of A/B tests, applying one-tail hypothesis testing to understand customer behavior, leading to an 18% increase in unique viewer metrics. I also optimized sales strategies using a reinforcement model and skillfully analyzed sales reports from distributors, employing advanced data engineering techniques to yield insightful business strategies.



## üî¨ Research Experience

### Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory | Research Assistant (September 2023 - Present)

Advised by [Alex Sim](https://crd.lbl.gov/divisions/scidata/sdm/staff/alex-sim/), [K. John Wu](https://crd.lbl.gov/divisions/scidata/sdm/staff/wu/), and [Jinoh Kim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CFehwB8AAAAJ&hl=en), I have been employing advanced deep learning methodologies, notably Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Conditional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), to analyze time series data using TensorFlow. This work involves conducting detailed analyses of Tstat format logs to develop innovative predictive methodologies and tools, primarily aimed at estimating and improving network performance.

### Haas School of Business, Berkeley Operations and Behavioral Analytics Lab | Research Assistant (September 2023 - Present)

Advised by [Park Sinchaisri](https://haas.berkeley.edu/faculty/park-sinchaisri/), my research centers on the dynamics of Human-AI collaboration, specifically through the lens of sequential decision-making and inverse reinforcement learning. A key aspect of our work involves the development of a two-player game employing Markov Decision Processes (MDP) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). This project is designed to explore the role of communication between players in collaborative settings. Our focus is on formulating strategic tips provided during the game and assessing their impact on team collaboration and decision-making. The game serves as a model for studying and enhancing Human-AI interactions, emphasizing the balance of team and individual goals through effective communication strategies.


## üìö Teaching 
As a torchbearer in the realm of teaching, I engage with students as a tutor and undergraduate instructor in Linear Algebra and Principle in Data Science. My approach to teaching is anchored in the philosophy of active and engaged learning. I believe in creating a dynamic learning environment where students are not just passive recipients of knowledge but active participants in their learning journey.
