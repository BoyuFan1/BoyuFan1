Greetings! üåç I'm Boyu Fan, a junior at UC Berkeley double majoring in Economics and Data Science. My academic journey is marked by a deep engagement in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence research at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Haas School of Business. Here, I'm exploring the complexities of LSTM and RNN within TensorFlow, and innovating on the future work of Human-AI interfaces("Can ML offer simple tips to help humans?").



## üîç Research Interest
My research interests lie at the intersection of advanced computational methodologies and data-driven analysis, particularly focusing on the application of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Conditional Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) within the TensorFlow framework. My work primarily revolves around time series data analysis in the context of network performance optimization. I am deeply engaged in developing novel predictive tools and methodologies, utilizing Tstat log data to enhance network efficiency and reliability.



## üå± Conservationist 
In the heart of Kenya, I found my calling as a conservationist with the Lion Light project, a initiative blending technology and environmental stewardship.

As the Chief Advocate, I've been instrumental in installing innovative lion lights, which uses blinking light patterns to ward off lions from the villager‚Äôs livestock. My role extends beyond just installation; it involves research, community engagement, and raising awareness. By raising $7000, we've expanded the project, installing 800 additional lights and earning heartfelt thanks from the local Kenyan community.

## üìä Work Experience
Deloitte | Risk Advisory Modeling Intern (May - August 2023)
In my role at Deloitte, I focused on enhancing sovereign risk models by performing rigorous data cleaning and feature extraction on datasets from the World Bank and IMF. I employed advanced feature engineering techniques like K-means and agglomerative clustering, along with univariate analysis using tools such as Somer's D, ROC, and information value. My work culminated in the construction of a sovereign risk classification model using logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, significantly improving the model's accuracy from 40% to 78% and streamlining data processing with proficient use of SQL.

Apple | Data Analysis Engineering Intern (July - August 2022)
At Apple, I collaborated with the Global Channel sales team to develop and execute effective business and sales strategies. My key contributions included orchestrating the design and implementation of A/B tests, applying one-tail hypothesis testing to understand customer behavior, leading to an 18% increase in unique viewer metrics. I also optimized sales strategies using a reinforcement model and skillfully analyzed sales reports from distributors, employing advanced data engineering techniques to yield insightful business strategies.



## üìö Teaching 
As a torchbearer in the realm of teaching, I engage with students as a tutor and undergraduate instructor in Linear Algebra and Principle in Data Science. My approach to teaching is anchored in the philosophy of active and engaged learning. I believe in creating a dynamic learning environment where students are not just passive recipients of knowledge but active participants in their learning journey.
